(Submitter supplied) Aging is the primary risk factor for most neurodegenerative diseases, yet the cell-type-specific progression of brain aging remains poorly understood. Here, human cell-type-specific transcriptomic aging clocks are developed using high-quality single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from post mortem human prefrontal cortex tissue of 31 donors aged 18–94 years, encompassing 73,941 high-quality nuclei. Distinct transcriptomic changes are observed across major cell types, including upregulation of inflammatory response genes in microglia from older samples. more...

2. Molecular Signatures of Resilience to Alzheimer’s Disease in Neocortical Layer 4 Neurons
(Submitter supplied) Single-cell omics is advancing our understanding of selective neuronal vulnerability in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), revealing specific subtypes that are either susceptible or resilient to neurodegeneration. Using single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomics to compare neocortical regions affected early (prefrontal cortex and precuneus) or late (primary visual cortex) in AD, we identified a resilient excitatory population in layer 4 of the primary visual cortex expressing RORB, CUX2, and EYA4. more...

3. Transcriptome study of Alzheimer's disease on post-mortem human brain
(Submitter supplied) INTRODUCTION: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in people with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) across all severity stages. Their heterogeneous presentation and variable temporal association with cognitive decline suggest shared and distinct biological mechanisms. We hypothesized that specific patterns of gene expression associate with distinct NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains in AD.  METHODS: Post-mortem bulk RNAseq on the insula and anterior cingulate cortex from 60 brain donors representing the spectrum of canonical AD neuropathology combined with natural language processing approaches based on the RDoC Clinical Domains.   RESULTS: Distinct sets of >100 genes (pFDR<0.05) were specifically associated with at least one clinical domain (Cognitive, Social, Negative, Positive, Arousal). more...

4. A pattern to rule them all: tracing a human brain map of shared molecular aspects across aging, Alzheimer’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies
(Submitter supplied) Aging is often characterized by a progressive loss of cognitive abilities due to the onset of different forms of dementia. Among these, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (LBD) are the most widespread ones. However, little is known about the common aspects between these conditions and how these aspects can be linked to aging itself. With this work, we aim to identify a molecular fil rouge that could link aging and different dementias in order to possibly highlight strategic targets for novel therapeutical approaches. more...

6. A global view of aging and Alzheimer’s pathogenesis-associated cell population dynamics in mammalian brain
(Submitter supplied) Prior studies applied single-cell approaches to explore gene expression changes in aged brains; however, they were limited by relatively shallow sampling of brain cell populations, and thus failed to characterize the detailed molecular signatures and dynamics of rare cell types associated with aging and diseases. Here, we set out to investigate the age-dependent transcriptional and chromatin dynamics across diverse brain cell types. more...

(Submitter supplied) AD neuropathologic change (ADNC) is known to be associated with numerous DNA methylation changes in the human brain, but the oldest old (>90 years) have so far been underrepresented in epigenetic studies of ADNC. Our study participants were individuals aged over 90 years (n= 47) from The 90+Study. We analyzed DNA methylation from bulk samples in eight precisely dissected regions of the human brain: middle frontal gyrus, cingulate gyrus, entorhinal cortex, dentate gyrus, CA1, substantia nigra, locus coeruleus and cerebellar cortex. more...

(Submitter supplied) Tau aggregation in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) is closely associated with neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the molecular signatures that distinguish between aggregation-prone and aggregation-resistant cell states are unknown. We developed methods for the high-throughput isolation and transcriptome profiling of single somas with NFTs fro¬m human AD brain, quantified the susceptibility of 20 neocortical subtypes for NFT formation and death, and identified both shared and cell-type-specific signatures. more...

Illumina 450K profiling of cells (nuclei) sorted from post- mortem human brains allowed us assigning cell type- specific epigenetic changes to aging and AD progression. Among a few thousand cell type-specific differentially methylated CpGs (DMCGs) changing with age we identify prominent clusters in the AD genes, CLU, SYNJ2, ANK1 and MCF2L. more...
